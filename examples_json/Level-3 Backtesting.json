      "The impact of the difference can vary depending on the characteristics of the strategy; for some strategies, Level-2 estimation may be sufficiently accurate, while for others, it may not be. This comparison is intended to highlight these differences. In markets that only provide Level-2 data, it is important to develop a realistic queue position model based on live trading data. Although Level-3 data offers direct order queue position information, it is still crucial to validate backtesting results against live trading results. For example, in this CME Level-3 backtest, the market depth doesn't include implied orders."
